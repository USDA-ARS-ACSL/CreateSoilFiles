to run the example 

"<Path to createSoilfiles exe>\CreateSoilFiles_CO2.exe" "<path to layer file>ASHD05.lyr" /GN ASHD05 /SN Eudora

if the layer file or executable or both is in the default folder then the path is not necessary

note that the excel interface will create this file for you as well as a batch file with the correct command to run the program.
